Transforming visual inputs into auditory experiences in OpenFrameworks. 
Utilizing webcam feeds, this project converts images into grayscale, sorts pixels using a Hilbert Curve for spatial integrity, and translates them into a range of sound frequencies.
Customizable with adjustable frequency sliders.
